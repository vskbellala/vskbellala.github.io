My personal website (wip)  
Very minimal. Original template was modified to have subpages and to customize colors and effects.  
It's basically taken a whole new level of its own.
I am not a coder so my knowledge of html/css concepts as well as Github is quite limited, unfortunately.

## Have done 
- Main landing page (name, description, links, etc.)
- a bunch of theme modifications (hover effects, font changes, etc.)
- about
- contact
- cv outline
  - Note: still have to add the actual cv
- 1 page ("#" links)
- minified html and own css
  - fonts are not minified. looking for solution
  - potentially serve them myself???
- no more fontawesome
  - only using pure css for webpage's design

## Todo
- Modify other themes in the template
  - currently missing extra css effects and colors
  - might not be necessary, as my duotone theme is working really well.
- Add more links. I am not sure what to add.
- clean up code/directory (in progress)
- fix fonts (CDNs are ugly)
