My personal website (wip)  
Very minimal. Original template was modified to have subpages and to customize colors and effects.  
It's basically taken a whole new level of its own.  
I am not a coder so my knowledge of html/css concepts as well as Github is quite limited, unfortunately.

## Have done 
- Main landing page (name, description, links, etc.)
- a bunch of theme modifications (hover effects, font changes, etc.)
- about
- contact
- 1 page ("#" links)
- links on landing are stylized to look like buttons
- html & css minified
  - 1 css file for the entire website (colors, fonts, padding, etc.)
- No CDNs
  - Font is served from the website
  - no third-party icons or anything like that

## Todo
- Add CV (link already exists)
- Modify other themes in the template
  - currently missing extra css effects and colors
  - might not be necessary, as my duotone theme is working really well.
- Add more links. I am not sure what to add.
- clean up code/directory (in progress)
