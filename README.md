My personal website (wip)  
Very minimal. Original template was modified to have subpages and to customize colors and effects.  
I am not a coder so my knowledge of html/css concepts as well as Github is quite limited, unfortunately.

## Have done 
- Main landing page (name, description, links, etc.)
- a bunch of theme modifications (hover effects, font changes, etc.)
- about
- contact
- cv outline (note: still have to add the actual cv)
- 1 page (finally figured out the "#" style links)

## Todo
- Modify other themes in the template (missing hover effects, etc.)
- Add more links. I am not sure what to add.
- Stop using fontawesome's icons? (Note: I have no clue for an alternative)
