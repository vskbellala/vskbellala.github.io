This was also a bit of a funky year, as first-years took their full load during the spring and summer semesters, rather than fall/spring. We were allowed one free class in the fall though. Feel free to reach out to me for any questions regarding these courses at my email <a href=mailto:jelynn_ellianna_tatad@brown.edu>jelynn_ellianna_tatad@brown.edu</a>.</p><hr><h2 id=fall-2020>Fall 2020</h2><h3 id=MATH0100>MATH0100 &ndash; Introductory Calculus II</h3><ul><li>Brown equivalent of AP Calculus BC or second semester calculus. I didn&rsquo;t place out of it because I took AP Calc AB in high school, so I took it because I was planning on concentrating in Applied Math-Biology.</li><li>A classic math class. Weekly homework assignments, weekly quizzes, and midterms every few weeks.</li><li>I did okay, had to really grind out a lot for the grade I wanted but ended up clutching in the end.</li><li><a href=https://thecriticalreview.org/search/MATH/0100>MATH0100</a> on The Critical Review</li></ul><h2 id=spring-2021>Spring 2021</h2><h3 id=CHEM0330>CHEM0330 &ndash; Equilibrium, Rate, Structure (General Chemistry)</h3><ul><li>Part one of the infamous chemistry sequence. Focuses on quantum mechanics, thermodynamics, and acids/bases (might be missing others)</li><li>Problem-solving based course. There are weekly group problem-solving sessions that I think are really essential to do well. These were pretty awkward in COVID breakout room form, but I&rsquo;m sure they were better in in-person format.</li><li>I personally did okay. Had too much on my plate so I didn&rsquo;t do as well as I&rsquo;d hoped, but it was my second best class grade this sem.</li><li>In my year, the course was taught by Brenda Rubenstein (a PHENOMENAL professor) and Ou Chen (who I didn&rsquo;t enjoy as much)</li><li><a href=https://thecriticalreview.org/search/CHEM/0330>CHEM0330</a> on The Critical Review</li></ul><h3 id=BIOL0200>BIOL0200 &ndash; Foundation of Living Systems</h3><ul><li>One of the most common classes used to fulfill a pre-med biology with lab course. The equivalent of high school AP Biology. I opted to take this class, thinking it would be a refresh of AP Bio. Which it kind of was, but the test questions were insane.</li><li>Assignments included weekly quizzes, lab reports, and non-cumulative exams. The quizzes and exams were more application-based questions, while lab was more straightforward. Had a very hard time with exams.</li><li>This class was taught by the legendary Ken Miller (who recently retired) and John Stein! Both are great lecturers.</li><li><a href=https://thecriticalreview.org/search/BIOL/0200>BIOL0200</a> on The Critical Review</li></ul><h3 id=MATH0180>MATH0180 &ndash; Intermediate Calculus</h3><ul><li>3rd semester calculus. Once again, took this because I was planning on concentrating in Applied Math-Biology</li><li>A classic math class. Weekly homework assignments, weekly quizzes, and midterms every few weeks.</li><li>The actual bane of my existence.</li><li>I hated this class&mldr; and the professor.</li><li>I changed my concentration to Biology after this course.</li><li><a href=https://thecriticalreview.org/search/MATH/0180>MATH0180</a> on The Critical Review</li></ul><h3 id=east0533----beyond-gangnam-style-seoul-dislocation-and-the-search-for-place>EAST0533 &ndash; Beyond Gangnam Style: Seoul, Dislocation, and the Search for Place</h3><ul><li>This was a really interesting course about the urban development and history of Seoul.</li><li>Lots of readings were assigned and everyone led a discussion week at one point. There were also 2 paper assignments, but the course wasn&rsquo;t WRIT.</li><li>I S/NCed the class, which honestly was perfect because there were so many readings that I would&rsquo;ve had a terrible time balancing my time.</li></ul><h2 id=summer-2021>Summer 2021</h2><h3 id=CHEM0350>CHEM0350 &ndash; Organic Chemistry I</h3><ul><li>Part two of the infamous chemistry sequence. A dreaded requirement for those who are pre-med, but most certainly very possible to do well in, despite its reputation of being difficult. I personally really enjoyed this class!</li><li>There are TA-designed packets that can help you get more practice with the different types of reactions you might encounter in exams. Be warned that these packets actually tend to be much more complicated than the exams are designed to be, as they&rsquo;re meant to ensure that you know these topics like the back of your hand. <strong>HIGHLY recommend using the suggested textbook problems instead to regularly test your knowledge.</strong></li><li>In my year, I was taught by Professor Charles Morton, and most of our grades were based on homework and lab. Be warned that this is to change, as Professor Matthew Zimmt is usually in charge of the course and will return to campus in Fall 2022 to teach the course again.</li><li><a href=https://thecriticalreview.org/search/CHEM/0350>CHEM0350</a> on The Critical Review</li></ul><h3 id=NEUR0010>NEUR0010 &ndash; Introduction to Neuroscience</h3><ul><li>An introductory neuroscience course. Pretty standard lecture course as far as format goes.</li><li>I found the material quite difficult and had a really hard time with the class. Neuroscience definitely was not for me.</li><li>Weekly quizzes and exams every couple of weeks. There&rsquo;s also a weekly review section that you sign up for during registration where the TAs will usually make review slides about the week/previous week&rsquo;s content!</li><li><a href=https://thecriticalreview.org/search/NEUR/0010>NEUR0010</a> on The Critical Review</li></ul><h3 id=SOC0020>SOC0020 &ndash; Perspectives on Social Interaction: An Introduction to Social Psychology</h3><ul><li>This course goes into different aspects of social interaction (hate, love, family, self presentation) in two different types of social paradigms.</li><li>Very interesting material, but SO much reading. I think that writing sociology papers is really weird and specific, and I don&rsquo;t think I grasped how I was supposed to write very well. I probably should&rsquo;ve S/NCed the course but I didn&rsquo;t.</li><li>It was a weird hybrid setting in that you were assigned a number and every 4th class, you can attend class in person to limit how many people are in the same room.</li><li>There were also discussion sections that were just okay. A bit awkward on break out rooms though.</li><li><a href=https://thecriticalreview.org/search/SOC/0020>SOC0020</a> on The Critical Review</li></ul><h3 id=GRMN0750F>GRMN0750F &ndash; Historical Crime Fiction</h3><ul><li>A really interesting literature course that goes through different crime fiction books that take place around the world!</li><li>Homework every week, a fairly normal amount of reading per class.</li><li>This was a first year seminar that had about 6 students, and I liked how close we felt even though we were in break out rooms for most of it.</li><li><a href=https://thecriticalreview.org/search/GRMN/0750F>GRMN0750F</a> on The Critical Review</li></ul></article></div><nav class=menu><a href=/ title target=_self>Home</a>
