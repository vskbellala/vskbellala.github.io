    <p><em>Here at Brown, you will come across a multitude of opportunities to conduct research, either on your own or with a faculty member. Think of this rough write-up as just a glimpse of where to look.</em></p>
<p>The explanations and sites linked here tend to be more Biomedical oriented, as these are the places I am most familiar with. However, research opportunities in say the humanities or CS are still very plentiful and not at all difficult to find. <a href="https://www.brown.edu/academics/biology/undergraduate-education/index.php?q=undergraduate-research">This page</a> may be helpful for folks interested in biology.</p>
<p>Generally speaking, when requesting to research with faculty, expect to send a resume (<a href="https://www.brown.edu/campus-life/support/careerlab/undergraduate-0/resumes-cover-letters-and-online-profiles">CareerLAB</a> has stellar guides and <a href="mailto:peercareeradvisors@brown.edu">Peer Career Advisors</a> can help revise it) and a letter explaining your skills and why you are interested in researching with this particular faculty member (more on that later).</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="research-listings">Research Listings</h2>
<p>Professors and faculty members looking for undergraduate researchers may post job listings (paid and unpaid) that you can apply to.</p>
<p><a href="https://apps.biomed.brown.edu/buro/">BioMed Undergraduate Research Opportunities</a> (BURO)</p>
<ul>
<li>BioMed faculty post research opportunities here, and they can be &ldquo;short-term, long-term, take place over summer or the academic year, those that are paid, voluntary, or take the form of a Biology independent study.&rdquo;</li>
<li>You can also find labs with continuous openings, as well as specifically look at projects within research areas that interest you.</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://www.brown.edu/about/administration/workday/">Workday</a></p>
<ul>
<li>Workday is Brown&rsquo;s internal listing of on-campus and remote jobs, and research opportunities (from a variety of departments) are also posted here. Applying via Workday is relatively straightforward. Make sure to include a resume and cover letter!</li>
<li>Following the provided link, job listings can be found as follows:
<ul>
<li>Login by clicking the big blue button labeled &ldquo;Workday Access&rdquo; and inputting your Brown credentials.</li>
<li>Once in, navigate to the search bar, and search the phrase &ldquo;Find Student Jobs.&rdquo; One more click and you&rsquo;ll arrive at the listings.</li>
<li>You can search through the listings and filter them to your specifications. Make sure you don&rsquo;t accidentally apply to old postings!</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="freezing-cold-emails">Freezing Cold Emails</h2>
<p>Not all professors are available on Workday and/or BURO. <a href="https://research.berkeley.edu/how-cold-email-professor">Cold emailing</a> a professor explaining your interest in their research might lead to some quite unique opportunities.</p>
<p><a href="https://vivo.brown.edu/">Researchers@Brown</a> is a searchable database of almost all faculty associated with Brown University, including those who also primarily work at Brown&rsquo;s graduate schools (ex. <a href="https://medical.brown.edu/">Warren Alpert Medical School</a>). You can search for specific faculty that match your own research interests by filtering for their affiliation, research areas, and more.</p>
<p>When I began my search for research opportunities, I ended up cold emailing first. Here is the particular approach I used (a very rough outline; many examples are also available online with a quick <a href="https://is.gd/RLPPn8">search</a>):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[Greeting] [Who am I? Year, Intended Concentration, Why am I interested in Research] [Request to join their lab]<br>
[Explain WHY their lab; what about their research intrigues you]<br>
[How can you contribute to their work (what skills do you have)? It is OK to say you have no prior experience; research is about <strong>learning</strong>]<br>
[Closing]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This sort of structure can also work perfectly for a cover letter.</p>
