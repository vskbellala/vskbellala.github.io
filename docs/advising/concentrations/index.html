    <p>Some quick blurbs I had my friends write. I hope this helps inform your concentration exploration!</p>
<p><strong>Prompt</strong>: What concentration are you declaring, what did you initially plan on doing, why are you declaring said concentration, and what have you done to explore it?</p>

<h2 id="jelynn">Jelynn - Biochemistry</h2>
<p>Declaring Biochemistry<br>
Entered as Biochemistry (but underwent an apma-bio -&gt; bio -&gt; biochem journey)</p>
<p><strong>Why:</strong> i like bio (kinda) and i like chem (kinda) therefore &hellip; also because at the time i took orgo, i liked it so much that i preemptively planned on taking orgo 3 and thought that it&rsquo;d make the most sense to link it with biochem rather than gen bio</p>
<p><strong>Exploration:</strong> followed my interests! i thought i liked math and bio but realized (early) that college math is very hard for me so i quit that quickly. and then i realized that i&rsquo;m not particularly strong at pure bio classes but really enjoyed chem, so basically just added the chemistry part because i still think the bio electives are cool :D</p>

<h2 id="angelina">Angelina - GNSS &amp; Public Health</h2>
<p>Declaring GNSS and Public Health<br>
Entered as GNSS and Slavic Studies</p>
<p><strong>Why:</strong> i&rsquo;m scared of failing in learning languages in a class. public health also i only heard of it here and it seemed to be a very good fit for my interests. i want to do stuff with a social look at things</p>
<h2 id="imran">Imran - Public Health &amp; Economics</h2>
<p>Declaring Public Health and Economics<br>
Entered as Biology</p>
<p><strong>Why:</strong> I was always noncommittal with Biology, it just seemed like something I <em>might</em> enjoy. I never took an Econ class in high school so I took ECON 0110 in my first semester, really enjoyed it, and have decided to keep running with it. I like public health because it plays well with economics. Healthcare in the US helped me connect those dots because it showed me how economics and public health are quite interconnected.</p>

<h2 id="ben">Ben - Mathematics and Computer Science</h2>
<p>Declaring Math-CS, maybe secondary in EAS or COGS<br>
Entered as APMA and Philosophy, then CS-Econ</p>
<p><strong>Why:</strong> I really like math and logic, and using my knowledge from those fields to build systems in cs is very fulfilling.</p>
<h2 id="madhu">Madhu - Biology &amp; Public Health</h2>
<p>Declaring Biology and Public Health<br>
Entered as Public Health and Classics</p>
<p><strong>Why:</strong> I took classes in Public Health at the local community college during high school, and I enjoyed them so wanted to continue studying Public Health at Brown. I chose Public Health since there are a wide variety of areas inside of the field, and having a Public Health background will be useful to me when I go into healthcare.</p>
<p><strong>Exploration:</strong> Taking a variety of different courses in the Public Health department at Brown, such as Pathology to Power and Healthcare in the US.</p>
