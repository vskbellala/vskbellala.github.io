I hope this helps inform your concentration exploration!</p><p><strong>Prompt</strong>: What concentration are you declaring, what did you initially plan on doing, why are you declaring said concentration, and what have you done to explore it?</p><hr><h2 id=jelynn>Jelynn - Biochemistry</h2><p>Declaring Biochemistry<br>Entered as Biochemistry (but underwent an apma-bio -> bio -> biochem journey)</p><p><strong>Why:</strong> i like bio (kinda) and i like chem (kinda) therefore &mldr; also because at the time i took orgo, i liked it so much that i preemptively planned on taking orgo 3 and thought that it&rsquo;d make the most sense to link it with biochem rather than gen bio</p><p><strong>Exploration:</strong> followed my interests! i thought i liked math and bio but realized (early) that college math is very hard for me so i quit that quickly. and then i realized that i&rsquo;m not particularly strong at pure bio classes but really enjoyed chem, so basically just added the chemistry part because i still think the bio electives are cool :D</p><p><a href=mailto:jelynn_ellianna_tatad@brown.edu>Email Jelynn.</a></p><h2 id=angelina>Angelina - GNSS & Public Health</h2><p>Declaring GNSS and Public Health<br>Entered as GNSS and Slavic Studies</p><p><strong>Why:</strong> i&rsquo;m scared of failing in learning languages in a class. public health also i only heard of it here and it seemed to be a very good fit for my interests. i want to do stuff with a social look at things</p><h2 id=imran>Imran - Public Health & Economics</h2><p>Declaring Public Health and Economics<br>Entered as Biology</p><p><strong>Why:</strong> I was always noncommittal with Biology, it just seemed like something I <em>might</em> enjoy. I never took an Econ class in high school so I took ECON 0110 in my first semester, really enjoyed it, and have decided to keep running with it. I like public health because it plays well with economics. Healthcare in the US helped me connect those dots because it showed me how economics and public health are quite interconnected.</p><p><a href=mailto:imran_dharamsi@brown.edu>Email Imran.</a></p><h2 id=ben>Ben - Mathematics and Computer Science</h2><p>Declaring Math-CS, maybe secondary in EAS or COGS<br>Entered as APMA and Philosophy, then CS-Econ</p><p><strong>Why:</strong> I really like math and logic, and using my knowledge from those fields to build systems in cs is very fulfilling.</p><h2 id=madhu>Madhu - Biology & Public Health</h2><p>Declaring Biology and Public Health<br>Entered as Public Health and Classics</p><p><strong>Why:</strong> I took classes in Public Health at the local community college during high school, and I enjoyed them so wanted to continue studying Public Health at Brown. I chose Public Health since there are a wide variety of areas inside of the field, and having a Public Health background will be useful to me when I go into healthcare.</p><p><strong>Exploration:</strong> Taking a variety of different courses in the Public Health department at Brown, such as Pathology to Power and Healthcare in the US.</p><p><a href=mailto:madhu@brown.edu>Email Madhu.</a></p></article></div></main><footer><hr><span id=copyright>Â© 2023 Venkatsai Bellala &#8226; <a href=https://github.com/vskbellala/vskbellala.github.io/commit/cb3010422986c6b0859adc59d2a8cf02e796076d>cb30104</a></span></footer></body></html>
