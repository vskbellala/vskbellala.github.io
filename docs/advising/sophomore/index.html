In my second year, I found myself taking more BME requirements and better defining what BME means to me.</em></p><p>Links to the <a href=https://thecriticalreview.org/>Critical Review</a> listing for the course are included, if available. I hope this helps with your search!</p><hr><h2 id=fall-2021>Fall 2021</h2><p><em>After the semester ended, I finally got around to declaring BME! I recommend beginning the <a href=/advising/declaring>declaration process</a> your third semester.</em></p><h3 id=ENGN1490>ENGN1490 &ndash; Biomaterials</h3><ul><li>Amazing, interdisciplinary introduction to the field of biomaterials taught from an engineering perspective. This was the first &ldquo;real&rdquo; BME class I had ever taken, and it allowed me to dip my feet into a myriad of different fields - from chemistry to materials science to mechanics.</li><li>Required for BME majors. Weekly psets were somewhat balanced in terms of math vs. writing - later psets became more writing heavy due to the final paper. Labs were mostly in groups, and provided a fun way to apply the concepts learned in class.</li><li>In my year, I had 2 take-home exams and 1 final paper where I research future materials for a biomedical application - writing heavy but fascinating!</li><li>Consider taking <a href=https://thecriticalreview.org/search/BIOL/1120>BIOL1120</a> for a biomaterials class with less focus on engineering principles.</li><li><a href=https://thecriticalreview.org/search/ENGN/1490>ENGN1490</a> on The Critical Review</li></ul><h3 id=BIOL0800>BIOL0800 &ndash; Principles of Physiology</h3><ul><li>Taught fully online in Fall 2021. Lecture and lab were asynchronous. Course tended to focus on application of concepts instead of memorization of said concepts in contrast to other courses.</li><li>Grade was determined by weekly quizzes, lab worksheets, and exams. Questions were multiple choice and free response. I personally had a tough time with said questions due to the perceived increased difficulty that comes with application-based questions.</li><li><a href=https://thecriticalreview.org/search/BIOL/0800>BIOL0800</a> on The Critical Review</li></ul><h3 id=PHP1510>PHP1510 &ndash; Principles of Biostatistics and Data Analysis</h3><ul><li>Taught hybrid (In-person + Zoom options). Here, I was introduced to statistics in the context of biology and public health. Specifically, I was able to learn about probability, random variables, exploratory data analysis, hypothesis testing, confidence intervals, and more. Regression is covered in the second course of this sequence, <a href=#PHP2511>PHP1511 / PHP2511</a>.</li><li>Additionally, I got to learn and work with R - a versatile programming language often used in statistics. Assignments consisted of 3 HWs, 2 take-home exams, and 1 final project. Consider registering for the graduate section, PHP2510, if you are ok with taking on some more work (usually a few extra problems per homework and exam; the lecture is the same).</li><li><a href=https://vivo.brown.edu/display/sdunsige>Professor Dunsiger</a> made this course amazing. She is very accommodating, receptive to student feedback, and teaches through a myriad of examples. I highly recommend taking this course, especially if she is teaching it.</li></ul><h3 id=PLME0400>PLME0400 &ndash; Introduction to Medical Illustration</h3><ul><li>Mandatory S/NC. Taught at <a href=https://medical.brown.edu/>AMS</a>. A very laid-back and low-stress class where you learn about the history of medical illustration and make drawings of your own. Harder to get into if not PLME, though.</li><li>Weekly drawing exercises in conjunction with field trips to <a href=https://www.lifespan.org/locations/rhode-island-hospital>RIH</a> and <a href=https://www.risd.edu/>RISD</a> provided ample opportunity to experiment with different styles and subjects (such as plants, models, and live surgeries).</li><li><a href=https://thecriticalreview.org/search/PLME/0400>PLME0400</a> on The Critical Review</li></ul><h2 id=spring-2022>Spring 2022</h2><p><em>This was my toughest semester yet, as I had never taken two ENGN classes before. Consider taking some of these courses <a href=/advising/snc/>S/NC</a> or choosing lighter courses to complement your heavier ones.</em></p><h3 id=ENGN0520>ENGN0520 &ndash; Electrical Circuits & Signals</h3><ul><li>Introduction to DC and AC circuit analysis. This class can be tough, but very informative and the skills I gained here can be applied to many different fields (such as Laplace transforms, etc.). The textbook is a great reference in case it is hard to understand lecture.</li><li>Assignments consisted of weekly problem sets, 3 exams (including 1 final), and 4 labs. Psets tended to take up the majority of my working time - especially as we entered the AC portion of the course (complex numbers go brr). During labs, you construct circuits in pairs on breadboards and log data using tools such as an oscilloscope. If you are unfamiliar with breadboards and building circuits, labs may take multiple 3-hour sessions to complete. <em>Be wary of your time.</em></li><li><a href=https://thecriticalreview.org/search/ENGN/0520>ENGN0520</a> on The Critical Review</li></ul><h3 id=ENGN0720>ENGN0720 &ndash; Thermodynamics</h3><ul><li>Required for most ENGN concentrations. Professors tended to utilize dense powerpoints in lecture. HW assignments are available but ungraded. Your grade is based on the two labs, three exams, and group final project.</li><li>The examples covered are very relevant, and have opened my eyes to the importance of thermodynamics. I took this course S/NC due to my concerns about the grading system.</li><li>During the group final project, your group designs a thermodynamic process to maximize Net Present Value. It can be quite time-consuming, but I personally had great fun working on it with my peers.</li><li><a href=https://thecriticalreview.org/search/ENGN/0720>ENGN0720</a> on The Critical Review</li></ul><h3 id=PHP2511>PHP2511 &ndash; Applied Regression Analysis</h3><ul><li>The second course in this public health statistics sequence, PHP2511 was a great time in my opinion. I chose to take the graduate section to challenge myself further. Lectures were the same regardless of section.</li><li>Content expands upon <a href=#PHP1510>PHP1510</a>, covering various regression models, their assumptions, and how to create said models using R. Professor Dunsiger taught PHP2511 this semester; she made the class amazing just as in PHP1510.</li></ul><h3 id=PLME0700>PLME0700 &ndash; Communication in Health Care</h3><ul><li>Offered for the first time Spring 2022. It covers various topics within communication and techniques used in the medical interview. Similar material is taught in medical school, so I found it fascinating to be able to learn this earlier.</li><li>Assignments consist of weekly writing assignments and a final project I worked on throughout the semester. I was able to conduct my own medical interviews with friends and family, as well as utilize qualitative analysis in writing my own paper. Overall, this course is interesting, but not stressful.</li></ul></article></div></main><footer><hr><span id=copyright>Â© 2023 Venkatsai Bellala &#8226; <a href=https://github.com/vskbellala/vskbellala.github.io/commit/4e224e3ddce59bd198f759efbde1e9f0a8cbc50d>4e224e3</a></span><nav class=menu><a href=/ title target=_self>Home</a>
