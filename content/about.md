Hello! My name is Venkatsai, but you can call me by my middle name, **Shri**. I am a first-year medical student at the [Warren Alpert Medical School of Brown University](https://medical.brown.edu/). I previously studied Biomedical Engineering at [Brown University](https://www.brown.edu/academics/biomedical-engineering/), where I was also part of the [PLME](https://plme.med.brown.edu/).

As an undergraduate, I investigated the effect of impact loading on brain cell populations in the [Srivastava Lab](https://sites.brown.edu/srivastavalab/). I previously interned for a summer at the [Mayo Clinic](https://college.mayo.edu/academics/biomedical-research-training/summer-undergraduate-research-fellowship-surf/), where I designed 3D microstructures for immune cell phenotyping. 

<!-- I studied meteorological and behavioral correlates of COVID-19 spread as an [REU](https://www.schmalelab.spes.vt.edu/REU/home.html) student in the [Marr Lab](http://www.air.cee.vt.edu/). -->

Outside of [academics](/research), I enjoy reading short stories, exploring [film photography](/photos), taking on small coding [projects](/projects), and writing the occasional [commentary](/advising) to support my [Meiklejohn](https://www.brown.edu/academics/college/advising/peer/) advisees.

<!-- I was formerly an [undergraduate researcher](/research) in the [Srivastava Lab](https://sites.brown.edu/srivastavalab/), where I studied the effect of applied mechanical loading on the function and expression of brain cell populations. I interned at the [Mayo Clinic](https://college.mayo.edu/academics/biomedical-research-training/summer-undergraduate-research-fellowship-surf/) in Summer 2023, where I designed 3D microstructures for efficient cell capture, to be integrated into a digital microfluidic platform for immune cell phenotyping. In Summer 2022, I investigated meteorological and behavioral correlates of COVID-19 transmissibility as a [REU](https://www.schmalelab.spes.vt.edu/REU/home.html) student in the [Marr Lab](http://www.air.cee.vt.edu/). -->

I previously conducted research in polymer mechanics and evaluating [environmental impacts on polymer performance](/assets/NE_Poster.pdf).

In Summer 2022, I researched [meteorological and behavioral correlates of COVID-19 transmissibility](/assets/VT_Bellala.pdf) as a [REU](https://www.schmalelab.spes.vt.edu/REU/home.html) student in the [Marr Lab](http://www.air.cee.vt.edu/). -->
