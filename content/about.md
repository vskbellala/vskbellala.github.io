I am a [PLME](https://plme.med.brown.edu/) junior studying Biomedical Engineering at [Brown University](https://www.brown.edu/). My pronouns are **He/Him**.

At Brown, I investigate the effect of applied mechanical loading on the function and expression of brain cell populations in the [Srivastava Lab](https://sites.brown.edu/srivastavalab/). I previously conducted research in polymer mechanics and evaluating environmental effects on polymer performance.

Last summer, I researched meterological and behavioral correlates of COVID-19 transmissibility as a [REU](https://www.schmalelab.spes.vt.edu/REU/home.html) student in the [Marr Lab](http://www.air.cee.vt.edu/).

I write [advising commentaries](/advising) to guide my [Meiklejohn](https://www.brown.edu/academics/college/advising/peer/) advisees.

In my free time, I enjoy reading short stories and engaging in [film photography](/photos).

I also love to try my hand at designing [websites](/projects/covid-visuals/) (and [dashboards](/projects/solar-charger)).
