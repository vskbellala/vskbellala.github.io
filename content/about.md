I am a junior at [Brown University](https://www.brown.edu/) concentrating in Biomedical Engineering. My pronouns are **He/Him**.

This summer, I am researching meterological correlates of COVID-19 incidence and reproduction number as a [REU](https://www.schmalelab.spes.vt.edu/REU/home.html) student in the [Marr Lab](http://www.air.cee.vt.edu/). Back at Brown, I investigate polymer mechanics in the [Srivastava Lab](https://sites.brown.edu/srivastavalab/).

I write [advising commentaries](/advising) to guide my [Meiklejohn](https://www.brown.edu/academics/college/advising/peer/) advisees.

I enjoy reading short stories and am passionate about open source technology, actively integrating it into my own life.

I also love to try my hand at designing [websites](/projects/covid-visuals/) (and [dashboards](/projects/solar-charger)).
