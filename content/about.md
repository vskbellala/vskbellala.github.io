# About Me

I am a high school senior at [MVHS](http://mvhs.ipsd.org/) and will be a freshman at [Brown](https://www.brown.edu/) in the fall. I plan to concentrate in Biomedical Engineering while pursuing knowledge as a PLME. I am thrilled by the prospect of learning all I can and seek every opportunity I can to better myself.

I am passionate about open source technology, actively integrating it into my own life. I enjoy reading short stories, biking or walking with my family, and catching up on the latest competitive baking shows. I also love to [build robots](https://sites.google.com/k12.ipsd.org/meteavalleyrobotics/home) and try my hand at [designing websites](https://github.com/vskbellala/vskbellala.github.io/).
