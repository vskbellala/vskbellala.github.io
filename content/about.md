My name is Venkatsai, but you can call me by my middle name, {{<mark>}}Shri{{</mark>}}. I am a [PLME](https://plme.med.brown.edu/) senior studying Biomedical Engineering at [Brown University](https://www.brown.edu/academics/biomedical-engineering/). **He/Him** pronouns.

I am currently an [undergraduate researcher](/research) in the [Srivastava Lab](https://sites.brown.edu/srivastavalab/), where I study the effect of applied mechanical loading on the function and expression of brain cell populations. I interned at the [Mayo Clinic](https://college.mayo.edu/academics/biomedical-research-training/summer-undergraduate-research-fellowship-surf/) in Summer 2023, where I designed 3D microstructures to efficiently capture cells per microliter of samples, to be integrated into a digital microfluidic platform for immune cell phenotyping. In Summer 2022, I investigated meteorological and behavioral correlates of COVID-19 transmissibility as a [REU](https://www.schmalelab.spes.vt.edu/REU/home.html) student in the [Marr Lab](http://www.air.cee.vt.edu/).



<!-- At Brown, I [investigate](/research) the effect of applied mechanical loading on the function and expression of brain cell populations in the [Srivastava Lab](https://sites.brown.edu/srivastavalab/). I previously conducted research in polymer mechanics and evaluating [environmental impacts on polymer performance](/assets/NE_Poster.pdf).

In Summer 2022, I researched [meteorological and behavioral correlates of COVID-19 transmissibility](/assets/VT_Bellala.pdf) as a [REU](https://www.schmalelab.spes.vt.edu/REU/home.html) student in the [Marr Lab](http://www.air.cee.vt.edu/). -->

<!-- I write [advising commentaries](/advising) to guide my [Meiklejohn](https://www.brown.edu/academics/college/advising/peer/) advisees. -->

I enjoy reading short stories, engaging in [film photography](/photos), taking on small coding [projects](/projects), and writing [commentaries](/advising) to guide my [Meiklejohn](https://www.brown.edu/academics/college/advising/peer/) advisees.

<!-- I also love to try my hand at designing [websites](/projects/covid-visuals/) (and [dashboards](/projects/solar-charger)). -->
