Despite the hecticness of finals period, I was able to go on a few photo walks before wrapping up my junior year at Brown. There is no real theme to these photos, except for them being taken around the same time. Joshua and I did venture into downtown Providence for some of these photos, however. Shot on Fuji 400.
