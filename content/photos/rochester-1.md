I am interning at the Mayo Clinic this summer, and was able to bring my camera for some of my time here. I've taken a few photos on my point and shoot (Cinestill 400D), and also finished off my roll (Ilford HP5+) in my main camera from the [North Carolina](/photos/north-carolina) trip. I plan on taking many more photos before I leave, so there will be a part 2.
