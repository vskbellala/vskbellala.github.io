My family and I spent a few days during this past winter break at a resort in [Punta Cana](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punta_Cana), a town located in the easternmost region of the Dominican Republic. While most of it was spent relaxing and enjoying the beach and food, I was able to snap a few photos. Shot on Fuji 400 +1 stop.
