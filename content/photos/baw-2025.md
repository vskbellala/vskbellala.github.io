I volunteered as a photographer for [Breeze Against Wheeze 2025](https://sites.google.com/view/breezeagainstwheeze2024/home), a 5K run/3K walk that raises money for the [Hasbro Childrenâ€™s Hospital Asthma Camp](https://www.brownhealth.org/centers-services/community-asthma-programs/asthma-camp). This camp helps kids from underserved communities learn how to manage their asthma while enabling them to engage in camping and outdoor recreational activities. It rained almost the whole time, which made things tricky, but I still managed to get some great shots of the race, the crowd, and the pre-run speeches. This event happens every year, and if you would like to donate or get involved, just shoot the organizers an email at [ams-baw@brown.edu](mailto:ams-baw@brown.edu)!
