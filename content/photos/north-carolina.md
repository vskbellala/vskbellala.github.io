I was able to visit North Carolina for the first time shortly before school ended for the year. I had visited with friends from high school, many of whom I have not met in-person since the pandemic. I finished off my roll of Candido 800 and also began a roll of Ilford HP5+ (pushed 2 stops) here. Can you spot the bonus photos I took when I visited Chicago with them a month later?
