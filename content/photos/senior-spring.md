These are some of my final moments from my last undergraduate year at Brown. These photos are from when I volunteered at the Hack @ Brown event as a photographer, from two walks to downtown Providence and Roger Williams Park with B-POP, and when I met my AC's kittens for the first time. I accidentally shot the Roger Williams walk on B&W film thinking it's color. Oops. Better luck next time!
