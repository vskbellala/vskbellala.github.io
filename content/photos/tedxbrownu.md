With the encouragement from my friend Joshua, I served as a volunteer photographer at the 2024 [TEDxBrownU](https://www.instagram.com/tedxbrownu/) Annual Conference. It was wonderful hearing from these speakers, and I had a great time taking photos and exploring low-light digital photography for the first time. The photos ended up a bit grainy, but I partially attribute that to the low lighting in the venue and the limited ISO ranges of the camera I borrowed from [B-POP](https://www.instagram.com/brownpvdphoto/) (Thank you for letting me borrow it though!).

Shot on a Canon EOS Rebel T100 APS-C Camera with 18-55mm lens.
