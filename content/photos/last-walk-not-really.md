In our final few days of college, Joshua and I went on our last photo walk together (for now). We walked along [Blackstone Boulevard](https://www.blackstoneparksconservancy.org/the-parks/blackstone-boulevard-park/), a 1.6 mile long and 100 foot wide park - situated on the median of a road - filled with beautiful trees, flowers, and grass. It was a fun time, and I will truly miss these photo walks. Shot on Candido 800, one stop overexposed.
