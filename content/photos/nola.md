My family and I drove down to New Orleans from Illinois for the July 4th weekend. We stopped only for a day in Memphis, Tennessee where we stayed in [The Peabody](https://www.peabodymemphis.com/), an iconic hotel known for its five resident Mallard ducks. It was too dark inside the hotel for me to take photos, sadly. While in New Orleans, we rode a steamboat, enjoyed the architecture, learned about Mardi Gras, and ate a lot of food. Mostly shot on Fuji 400, with some on Candido 800 +1 stop.
