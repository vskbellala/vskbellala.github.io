Film photography is a hobby of mine. I've enjoyed it a lot, and organized some of my favorites into the posts below.

{{<spoiler "Equipment">}}
- Cameras: 
    - Nikon F-601 with 50mm f/1.8 AF, 35-70mm f/3.3-4.5 AF, 70-210mm f/4-5.6 AF
    - Polaroid 3200AF (28mm f/4.5 1/125s)
- Film stocks: Mostly Fujifilm Superia 400, with some Fuji C200, Ilford XP2 Super, and expired Kodak Gold 200 mixed in.
- Developed and scanned at [Kerry's Warwick Photo](http://www.kerryswarwickphoto.com/) in Warwick, RI.
