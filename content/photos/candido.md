Candido recently released a line of film stocks. The one I shot, Candido 800, seems to be respooled Kodak cinema film. In other words, it is similar to Cinestill (although I have not experimented with the latter just yet). The colors are quite beautiful and ooze nostalgia. More photos taken with this stock can be found in my post about my trip to [North Carolina](/photos/north-carolina).

Also, I rated the film at 400 ISO (1 stop overexposure). I think it gives nicer results in daylight.
