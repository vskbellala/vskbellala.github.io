After multiple failed eBay escapades, I was able to get a Nikon F-601 QD with a 35-70mm lens in great condition! The autofocus, albeit slow and sometimes wonky, and the infalliable matrix metering are the highlights of this camera for me. I have to use CR-P2 batteries though, which isn't ideal. I personally use 2 CR123 batteries in series with a paperclip connecting the two. Shot on Fuji Superia 400 and Fuji C200.
