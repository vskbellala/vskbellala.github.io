With the [Open Curriculum](https://www.brown.edu/academics/undergraduate/open-curriculum), you are free to develop your own personalized course of study - from selecting or creating your own concentration to choosing any and all electives that interest you. As the "architect" of your own education, making a plan is crucial so you can stay on track with concentration requirements whilst remaining free to explore your interests.

Many students choose to create a four year plan that documents the coursework they plan to complete during their time at Brown. It is especially helpful when inputting your course list in your concentration [declaration](/advising/declaring). We've created a template using Google Sheets so you can create and track your very own four year plan. Feel free to use it, or modify it to make it your own!
