This is a [Google Calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/embed?src=c_cqq0gdipfa2tr9i2dskselrto0%40group.calendar.google.com&ctz=America%2FNew_York) of important dates and deadlines for your first semester. You can view it if you are logged into your Brown Google account, and even add it to your own calendar software by clicking the blue "+" button. The [Office of the Registrar](https://www.brown.edu/about/administration/registrar/) also maintains an [academic calendar](https://www.brown.edu/about/administration/registrar/academic-calendar), which I recommend bookmarking for convenience.

It may seem like too much to keep track of, but we Meiklejohns are here to help. I will do my best to send out reminders as these dates approach.
