**Update (October 2, 2025):** This article was cited in [*Freezing Cold Emails*](https://education.med.brown.edu/sites/default/files/Freezing%20Cold%20Emails.pdf), a guide to cold emailing by Dr. Stephanie Garbern, [Director of Medical Student Research ](https://education.med.brown.edu/student-enrichment/student-research-resources) at the Warren Alpert Medical School. I highly recommend checking it out!

*Here at Brown, you will come across a multitude of opportunities to conduct research, either on your own or with a faculty member. Think of this rough write-up as just a glimpse of where to look.*

The explanations and sites linked here tend to be more Biomedical oriented, as these are the places I am most familiar with. However, research opportunities in say the humanities or CS are still very plentiful and not at all difficult to find. [This page](https://www.brown.edu/academics/biology/undergraduate-education/index.php?q=undergraduate-research) may be helpful for folks interested in biology. 

Generally speaking, when requesting to research with faculty, expect to send a resume ([CareerLAB](https://www.brown.edu/campus-life/support/careerlab/undergraduate-0/resumes-cover-letters-and-online-profiles) has stellar guides and [Peer Career Advisors](mailto:peercareeradvisors@brown.edu) can help revise it) and a letter explaining your skills and why you are interested in researching with this particular faculty member (more on that later).

## Research Listings

Professors and faculty members looking for undergraduate researchers may post job listings (paid and unpaid) that you can apply to.

[BioMed Undergraduate Research Opportunities](https://apps.biomed.brown.edu/buro/) (BURO)
- BioMed faculty post research opportunities here, and they can be "short-term, long-term, take place over summer or the academic year, those that are paid, voluntary, or take the form of a Biology independent study." 
- You can also find labs with continuous openings, as well as specifically look at projects within research areas that interest you.

[Workday](https://www.brown.edu/about/administration/workday/)
- Workday is Brown's internal listing of on-campus and remote jobs, and research opportunities (from a variety of departments) are also posted here. Applying via Workday is relatively straightforward. Make sure to include a resume and cover letter!
- Following the provided link, job listings can be found as follows:
    - Login by clicking the big blue button labeled "Workday Access" and inputting your Brown credentials.
    - Once in, navigate to the search bar, and search the phrase "Find Student Jobs." One more click and you'll arrive at the listings.
    - You can search through the listings and filter them to your specifications. Make sure you don't accidentally apply to old postings!

## Freezing Cold Emails

Not all professors are available on Workday and/or BURO. [Cold emailing](https://research.berkeley.edu/how-cold-email-professor) a professor explaining your interest in their research might lead to some quite unique opportunities.

[Researchers@Brown](https://vivo.brown.edu/) is a searchable database of almost all faculty associated with Brown University, including those who also primarily work at Brown's graduate schools (ex. [Warren Alpert Medical School](https://medical.brown.edu/)). You can search for specific faculty that match your own research interests by filtering for their affiliation, research areas, and more.

When I began my search for research opportunities, I ended up cold emailing first. Here is the particular approach I used (a very rough outline; many examples are also available online with a quick [search](https://is.gd/RLPPn8)):


> [Greeting] [Who am I? Year, Intended Concentration, Why am I interested in Research] [Request to join their lab]  
> [Explain WHY their lab; what about their research intrigues you]  
> [How can you contribute to their work (what skills do you have)? It is OK to say you have no prior experience; research is about **learning**]  
> [Closing]

This sort of structure can also work perfectly for a cover letter.
