Some quick blurbs I had my friends write. I hope this helps inform your concentration exploration!

**Prompt**: What concentration are you declaring, what did you initially plan on doing, why are you declaring said concentration, and what have you done to explore it?

## Jelynn - Biochemistry {#jelynn}
Declaring Biochemistry  
Entered as Biochemistry (but underwent an apma-bio -> bio -> biochem journey)

**Why:** i like bio (kinda) and i like chem (kinda) therefore ... also because at the time i took orgo, i liked it so much that i preemptively planned on taking orgo 3 and thought that it'd make the most sense to link it with biochem rather than gen bio

**Exploration:** followed my interests! i thought i liked math and bio but realized (early) that college math is very hard for me so i quit that quickly. and then i realized that i'm not particularly strong at pure bio classes but really enjoyed chem, so basically just added the chemistry part because i still think the bio electives are cool :D

## Angelina - GNSS & Public Health {#angelina}
Declaring GNSS and Public Health  
Entered as GNSS and Slavic Studies

**Why:** i'm scared of failing in learning languages in a class. public health also i only heard of it here and it seemed to be a very good fit for my interests. i want to do stuff with a social look at things

## Imran - Public Health & Economics {#imran}
Declaring Public Health and Economics  
Entered as Biology

**Why:** I was always noncommittal with Biology, it just seemed like something I *might* enjoy. I never took an Econ class in high school so I took ECON 0110 in my first semester, really enjoyed it, and have decided to keep running with it. I like public health because it plays well with economics. Healthcare in the US helped me connect those dots because it showed me how economics and public health are quite interconnected.

## Ben - Mathematics and Computer Science {#ben}
Declaring Math-CS, maybe secondary in EAS or COGS  
Entered as APMA and Philosophy, then CS-Econ

**Why:** I really like math and logic, and using my knowledge from those fields to build systems in cs is very fulfilling.

## Madhu - Biology & Public Health {#madhu}
Declaring Biology and Public Health  
Entered as Public Health and Classics

**Why:** I took classes in Public Health at the local community college during high school, and I enjoyed them so wanted to continue studying Public Health at Brown. I chose Public Health since there are a wide variety of areas inside of the field, and having a Public Health background will be useful to me when I go into healthcare.

**Exploration:** Taking a variety of different courses in the Public Health department at Brown, such as Pathology to Power and Healthcare in the US.
