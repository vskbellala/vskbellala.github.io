I designed and built a website with Fomantic-UI to present our findings from scratch and utilized Python to create data visualizations.

## Technologies used

- Python ([Plotly](https://plotly.com/python/) for visuals)
- HTML
- CSS ([Fomantic-UI](https://fomantic-ui.com/) + Custom Styles)
- Some [JS](https://marked.js.org/)
- And Markdown too
