I have coded much of the website's interactive, JS-based portions, including gauges and plots that automatically refresh at a specified interval (pictured above). I am currently working on coding the HTML and CSS portions of the dashboard.

## Technologies used

- JS ([JustGage](https://github.com/toorshia/justgage) and [Plotly JS](https://plotly.com/javascript/), plus some XMLHttpRequest)
- [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/)
