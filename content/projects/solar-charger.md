An online, responsive dashboard for monitoring the status of our solar charging station we designed and built as members of [Scientists for a Sustainable World](https://www.facebook.com/BrownS4SW/). I coded much of the website's JS portions, including gauges and plots that automatically refresh at a specified interval.

### Technologies used

- HTML
- CSS
- JS ([JustGage](https://github.com/toorshia/justgage) and [Plotly JS](https://plotly.com/javascript/), plus some XMLHttpRequest)
- [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/)
