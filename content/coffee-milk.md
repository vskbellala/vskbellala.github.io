### Translation
[*Yuri Gagarin*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yuri_Gagarin):

Dear friends, both known and unknown (to me), fellow countrymen, and people of all countries and continents.

In a few minutes a mighty spaceship will carry me into the far-away expanses of the Universe.

///

What can I say to you in these last minutes before the start?

My whole life seems to me now to be one wonderful moment.

Everything I have experienced and done till now has been experienced and done for this moment.

///

Joy?

No, it was not just joy.

Pride?

No, it was not just pride.

I felt great happiness to be the first to enter the cosmos, to engage single-handed in an unprecedented duel with nature.

Could I dream of anything greater than that?

But then I thought of the tremendous responsibility I bore: to be the first to do what generations of people had dreamed of; to be the first to pave the way into space for mankind.

Can you think of a task more difficult than the one assigned to me?

This responsibility is not towards one person, not towards a few dozen, not towards a group.

It's a responsibility towards all Soviet people, towards all mankind, towards its present and its future.

And if I am nevertheless venturing on this flight, it's because I'm a Communist, because I have behind my back examples of unparalleled heroism of my fellow countrymen, the Soviet people.
