Back in high school, I was the lead builder & designer for my robotics team 8995M Mustang Voltage, 3x VEX Worlds Qualifiers. I additionally co-managed a [Twitter](https://twitter.com/mvrobotics8995) account, [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@MMustangVoltage/) channel and website for Metea Robotics.
